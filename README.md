If you're just like me, a big fan of GitHub, then chances are you'd like to get more involved in open source projects.
GitHub Commitment is the result of some thinking about a way to challenge myself to do so and I'd be glad to have you joining in.
The goal is to contribute to GitHub's public projects as much as possible, at least once a day (if possible).
To measure that involvment and see how I'm doing, I can't think of a better indicator than GitHub's contribution graph.
You get a "green box" for each contribution, which GitHub considers to be:

* Submitting an issue
* Submitting a Pull Request
* Pushing code to a public repo's default or `gh-pages` branch

As I'm writing this, it's been a month since I started the challenge and here are a few things I can tell you about it:

1. It forces you to be creative and find ways to contribute and/or create stuff
2. It helps with your work/life balance as you need to build a new habit and not just a one-week challenge
3. It's rewarding thanks to GitHub's contribution graph, especially knowing the importance of GitHub for today's developers

Having you aboard would be even more awesome for a few reasons.
First, it's always great to make connections and work with people.
Second, publicly telling to the world that you're in a challenge is a great way to stay motivated.
And finally, we can contribute to each other's projects so the more we are, the more there are ways to make a daily contribution.

If you do want to take part in the challenge, feel free to submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Zhouzi/github-commitment/pulls) or an [issue](https://github.com/Zhouzi/github-commitment/issues).
I've also created a [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Zhouzi/github-commitment) so we can chat about cool ideas, projects, suggestions or whatever.
