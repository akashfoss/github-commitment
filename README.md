I think that most of us would like to get more involved in the open source community.
Be it building our own stuff or helping others by submitting issues and pull requests.
But, for some reasons, it's hard sometimes to keep up the motivation.
So let's challenge ourselves to get more committed by contributing to public GitHub projects.

Now, we need a way to measure how we're doing towards that goal and I cannot think of a better indicator than GitHub's contribution graph.
It's both a great tracking tool and a rewarding system.

Don't take me wrong: the goal is not to fill green boxes but to contribute more.
But trying to fill that graph has a few advantages:

## It's rewarding

I believe that GitHub is the new resume and also a great portfolio.
It's kind of the developers' dribbble.
So having a graph filled with green boxes shows to everyone (fellow coders, recruiters, ...) how committed you are to the open source community.

## Work/life balance

That commitment is intended to be a long term goal.
The purpose is not to push hundreds of commits in a week to then go back to the old habits.
By trying to do so, you'll probably end up writing less code but more often.
You'll need to plan for the days to come, to find projects/ideas to work on.
Maybe you'll need to slow down and keep some code for later.

In the end, chances are you'll get more creative while improving your work/life balance.

## Participants

Another great way to stay motivated is to show your engagement to the world.
By being a "participant" you're publicly saying that you do plan to be more active.
But joining this list also brings more ways to contribute as we can then help each other.
