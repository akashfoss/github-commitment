# GitHub Commitment

Let's admit it: having a wall of green boxes on your GitHub profile looks really cool.
So why not challenging ourselves to greenify that graph and of course, the darker the better :)

## What's the point?

Filling stats for the sake of it is pointless.
GitHub Commitment should just be a source of motivation for us to contribute to an open source GitHub project at least once a day.
If earning green boxes is your only motivation, then there are [automated tools](https://github.com/avinassh/rockstar) for that.

But then let's be honest, there are days where you just can't do it.
In such case, I guess keeping a commit or two to be pushed is ok (but you'll have to create the commit the day you want it to be counted for).

> Wow, that's ridiculous!

I hear you but this project is supposed to be a funny source of motivation, not a stressful constraint.

## What if I missed a day?

The point is not necessarily to have the longest streak and no holes in the wall.
It's just about being commited and more active so do not fear too much about missing a day, it'll always be better than what it used to be.

## How do I get involved?

Just submit a pull request adding your name and the date you started your commitment (have a look at the [Participants](#participants) for examples).
